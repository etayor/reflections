When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The main reason I can think of is if the project is collaborative and people want to make changes from their own computers.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Doing it manually gives you more control over what gets updated and when.
