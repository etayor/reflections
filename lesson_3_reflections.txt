When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?
The main reason I can think of is if the project is collaborative and people want to make changes from their own computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Doing it manually gives you more control over what gets updated and when.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is not related to the other two.  It is for your local file that you want to update without risking already completed code.  A clone is when you copy an existing file or your own, on to your local drive.  A fork is strictly a github function and will do the same thing as a clone but will only copy a file from someone else's github account to your github account.
