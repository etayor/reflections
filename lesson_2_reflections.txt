What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?
It seems that initializing a repository will create a new, empty repository.  I'm not entirely sure why you need to do it other than when creating repositories often times it would probably be desirable to start from scratch.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?
I'm not entirely sure.  It seems the directory and repository hold everything while the staging area lets you control what files you put inside it.  The value I think it offers would primarily come from it giving you the ability to control which files you commit.
